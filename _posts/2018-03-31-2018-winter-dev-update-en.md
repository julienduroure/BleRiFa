It's already time to give some news :)


# [ExtraGroups][1] :  
A corrective version v1.0.1 is now available. Some detected bugs are now fixed.

# [BoneChainRenamer][3] :
This addon is now available for everyone. Really useful to rename easily bone chains.  
Some bugs are detected in corner case, a corrective version should be out in next weeks.

# [BonePicker][2] :
This addon lets you select your superimposed bones.  
I didn't make any news on this addon yet, but a test version is already available.

# On [JulienDuroure.com][4]
*  French: I give a speech about rigging for _[Toulouse Game Dev][5]_
*  French: Video of my talk at _[Capitole du Libre][6]_ is now available on youtube.

Some other project will probably be released during next months :)
