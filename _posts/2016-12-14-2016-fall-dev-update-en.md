Hi all,
Trying to make it become a quarter tradition, here is some news of past months :)

# Blender Conference
I gave a talk about [BleRiFa][1] this year. If you didn't see it yet, [read my report, and watch the video][2].

# BoneChainRenamer
I made some updates on tool [BoneChainRenamer][3]:  
Prior to updates I made, when you rename multiple chains, sort of chains was done alphabetically. This is now possible to choose how to sort chains :  

*  By distance
*  By location (X/Y/Z and X/Y/Z reversed)

Documentation page still need to be updated.

# ExtraGroups

*  New starting panel, from where you can:  
	*  Import from Bone Groups
	*  Import from Keying Sets
	*  Import from Selection Sets


*  These 3 importers are also available from Addon User Preferences
*  Edit mode checkbox is now available directly on panel, not only on Addon User Preferences
*  'Current Selection' group is now available by default
*  When user changed tab where addon is displayed, and Addon is enabled in User Preferences, Addon stays in right tab at launch.
*  And bug fixing of course!
*  development part : modifying way to import module, now I can use F8 to reload
*  more developments are in progress, but instable for now. Will be detailled on winter dev update ;-)

Documentation page still need to be updated.

# AutoSnap

*  development part : modifying way to import module, now I can use F8 to reload

# AutoRefSpace

*  development part : modifying way to import module, now I can use F8 to reload

# Website
Not so much update on [BleRiFa][1] website in few previous month ... but I worked on a totally new version of [my website][4]. This new version is also based on [jekyll][5].  
Lots of improvment I made on [my website][4] will be ported to [BleRiFa][1] in next months.
