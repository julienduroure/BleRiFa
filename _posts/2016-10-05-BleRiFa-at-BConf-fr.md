[Blender Conference][1] is a real highlight of the year for all people using [Blender][2].  
This year, it take place in Amsterdam (like every year), from 28 to 30, October.  

I am really happy to have a talk this year, about [BleRiFa][3]. It will be on Salon, at 12h00, on Friday.  
If you attend to BConf, be free to come and have a discussion or drink a beer, before or after my talk  
(will be there all 3 days)
