Hi all!

Like every year, the famous Blender Conference will take place in Amsterdam, end of October. I will be there, like previous years.  

I will be happy to have a speach, to show you part of my work. You can find the [schedule here][1]. My talk is planned at 4PM, on saterday 27th.  
I won't speak about my development about [BleRiFa][2], but if you planned to go to Amsterdam for the BConf too, don't hesitate to come to me to talk about rigging, animation, BleRiFa, TechArt, or any other subject (or to drink a beer). It will be a pleasure!
