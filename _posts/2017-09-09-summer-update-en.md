What's new on BleRiFa?  
No big updates these last months, was quite busy (work & personnal stuff). I took a few weeks of vacation too.

# [FootRollBreak][1]
I started to work on a new version of this addon. For now, I only worked on a new version of the rig, and I have now to implement it into the code.

# New addons
My last freelance missions make me think about new addons that can help me. Nothing to show for now, only ideas :)
