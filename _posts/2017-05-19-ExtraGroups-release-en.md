Hi all,  
[ExtraGroups addon][1] v1.0 is now released!  
[ExtraGroups addon][1] is an addon simplying your animation workflow.  
You can manage your bone groups (create / delete / sort groups, and adding / removing bone(s) from groups).  
For each group, you can use some operators (you can customize which one are displayed, and in which order).  

Version 1.0 is now available on [gumroad][2] and [BlenderMarket (or will be in following days, waiting validation)][3].
