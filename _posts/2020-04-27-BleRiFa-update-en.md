Hello,

As you may have seen, it has been a long time since I posted any news here.
Version 2.80 was released last summer, and since then, the only work done has been the conversion of the code to version 2.80+ of the following tools:

* [ExtraGroups][1]
* [BoneChainRenamer][2]
* [MassKeyingSets][3]
* [PanelMaker][4]

The following tools will not be ported on version 2.80+:

* [SwitchAnimView][5], because now this functionality is included by default in Blender (but the [repository][15] is there anyway)
* [FootRollBreak][6], because Rigify has evolved a lot since, and the code is no longer really usable (but the [repo][14] is there if you want)

So life goes on, I don't have time to develop all these tools. This is why I decided to make the code available to whoever wants it! It's here:

* [ExtraGroups][7]
* [BoneChainRenamer][8]
* [MassKeyingSets][9]
* [PanelMaker][10]

And as a bonus, two code repository that people ask me regularly. The migration to version 2.80+ is not done, but the code being available, I hope someone will perform it!

* [AutoSnap][11] ([documentation][12] et [repo][11])
* [AutoRefSpace][13] ([documentation][16] et [repo][13])

I wish the best for these lines of code! Don't hesitate to fork, and/or comment if you find these tools usefull!
