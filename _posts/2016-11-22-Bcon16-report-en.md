Hi all,  
I'm back after this year _Blender Conference_. I'd like to make a small report about these 4 days (3 days of conference, and one open house day at _Blender Institute_).  

First, I want to say that it was sooo goooood to meet friends again. And of course to meet some new people :)
Each people is truly accessible, including beginers, experts, including _Blenderheads_ and developpers that work for _Blender Institute_ or _Blender Fondation_.

Big first time for me (even if it was my 5th conference) : I gave a talk on [BleRiFa][1].  
First satisfaction : Audience was here (More people than I expected).

If you want to see my talk, here is the video (with my bad english linked to stress) :

After this talk, I can meet some great people to speak about my work :

* I met [Luciano][2], who tests [ExtraGroups][3] tool. We already discuss about this tool on Internet, but it was first IRL time. We discussed about his tests, and ideas for new features / more user friendly use of it.

* I also met [Jason][4], from [Nimble Collective][12], that I knew only worldwide. He will test [ExtraGroups][3] in next weeks. [Mass KeyingSets][5] was born after a discussion we had :)

* [Nathan Dillow][6], newly working for [Agent 327][7] at _Blender Institute_, is also interested by my work, and he's currently testing [ExtraGroups][3].

* I met Lucio & Ivan, from [MAD Entertainment][7]. They are currently working, on Blender side, on update / bug correction and new features for [Rigify][8]. You can see [their talk here][9]. As they said during this talk, they are really interested by [ExtraGroups][3]. We next, after conference, discuss by email to know how to setup a bridge between [Rigify][8] and [ExtraGroups][3].

* On another subject, Lucio & Ivan alert me on problems they met on [Rigify][8], that are present on [AutoRefSpace][10] too. I added this on my TODO list, I really need to have a better look on it.

* Then, I met Patrick, that explain me some bugs that he had on Pitchipoy version of [Rigify][8]. I started to analyse it, but it will probably be more detailled in another post.

As you can see, these few days on Amsterdam was very successful. This year more than previous ones, I was really a lucky guys to be there :)
