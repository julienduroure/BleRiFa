It's already time to give some news :)  
Unfortunately, not so much news this time. I didn't have lot's of time to work on addons, but I did some prods, and I get some ideas for future tools.

# [BoneChainRenamer][1] :
I released a corrective version 0.1.1

# On [JulienDuroure.com][2]
*  I give a speach for [Blender User Group in Paris][3]
*  I started developping a [glTF importer for Blender][4]. You will probably have some news of it in next months
