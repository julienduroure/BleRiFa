# Getting Started
If you don't know how to install Addon, read [following documentation]({{site.base_url}}/AddonInstallation/).  

# Early presentation  
There is currently no official documentation of this Addon, development is in progress.  

This Addon creates some groups of bones, and you can manage your groups:  

* Selection stuff (add/remove/toogle)  
* Make bones not selectable  
* Show / Hide bones  
* Mute bone animations  

{% include html5video.html id="ExtraGroups_1.ogv" %}

Lots of features are not displayed on this introduction video :  

* Use current selection instead of bone group  
* Create easily your own actions  
* ...
