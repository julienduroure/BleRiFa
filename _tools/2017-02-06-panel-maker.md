# Getting Started
If you don't know how to install Addon, read [following documentation][1].  

# Overview

This addon is used to create quickly & easily some UI tools for your rig.  
{% include html5video.html id="PanelMaker_2.ogv" %}

# How it works

Based on lines and columns, you can layout your tools as you want.  

Current tools that can be added:  
*  Switch bone layer
*  custom property (for IK/FK switching for example)
*  Switch scene layer
*  Any properties of any objects

# Current limitations
Panel is currently dynamically generated, and can't be exported (for linking or sharing .blend files outside of using this addon). This is on TODO list ;-)

# How to report bugs or request new features ?
You can report bugs on [Issue Tracker][2]
